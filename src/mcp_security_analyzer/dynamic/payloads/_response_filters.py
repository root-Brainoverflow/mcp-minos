"""Filters that distinguish real exploit success from payload reflection.

When a server rejects a fuzzing payload at validation (Pydantic, JSON Schema,
etc.) its error response often echoes the original input. RCE / disclosure
indicators inside that echo look identical to a real exploit hit but the
payload never executed — the server short-circuited at the schema layer.

Two complementary helpers:

``is_validation_rejection``
    True when the response is *clearly* a validation rejection. Used by
    scanners to short-circuit ``looks_like_*_success`` checks entirely.

``strip_input_echoes``
    Removes framework-specific ``input_value=...`` / ``instance: ...``
    spans before substring matching. Used by the ``looks_like_*`` heuristics
    so any indicator that survives the strip is more likely real output.

    Regression: ses-45ee8108 — Ghidra ran ``os.path.basename`` on the JNDI

      * **Both-sides** — ``<left_boundary>CANARY<right_boundary>``, kept for

    Left-sep-only is deliberately NOT emitted: payload canaries are

    output is ALSO commonly preceded by whitespace (``Output: CANARY``).
    Masking ``<space>CANARY`` would silence real exploit hits.
