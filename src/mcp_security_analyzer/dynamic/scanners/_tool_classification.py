"""Heuristics for classifying MCP tool capabilities.

The exploitation-indicator scanners (R2 RCE, R5 path-traversal /
SQL / NoSQL) assume the server *produces* response text from its own
internal evaluation — a server that returns ``uid=1000`` is leaking shell
output, a server that returns ``root:x:0:0`` is leaking ``/etc/passwd``.

That assumption breaks for **retrieval tools** whose entire purpose is
to return *external corpus* content. Wikipedia's ``search`` tool returns
article bodies; arxiv returns paper abstracts; YouTube returns transcript
text. Such corpora legitimately contain every exploitation-indicator
string ever invented — the Wikipedia article on XXE attacks contains
``file:///etc/passwd`` as a literal example, the PHP article contains
``PHP Version 8.5``, the Unix passwd article contains the passwd-file
format. Pattern-matching these against ``looks_like_rce_success`` /
``looks_like_traversal_success`` produces 100 %% false positives.

ses-50a348b0 regression: ``wikipedia-mcp`` produced 3 CRITICAL findings
(RCE on PHP article, RCE on passwd article, path-traversal on XXE
article). All 3 were Wikipedia returning relevant articles for our
payload keywords — no exploitation, just retrieval doing its job.

The fix is to *recognise* retrieval tools and apply stricter checks:

* RCE detection switches to canary-only mode (``RCE_CANARY_7f3a9c``
  cannot occur in any external corpus we know of, so a match IS evidence).
* Path-traversal / SQL / NoSQL error indicators are skipped entirely —
  none of them have a canary mechanism and all rely on generic text
  patterns that retrieval-tool output reproduces by construction.
* Other R5 checks (NoSQL leak, type-confusion unhandled-error) remain;
  those depend on response *shape* rather than content keywords.

    Looks for retrieval-purpose keywords in the tool's name, description,
    and the host server's self-declared name. The lattermost is important
    — ``wikipedia-mcp`` exposes a tool literally named ``search`` whose
    own description ("Search Wikipedia") matches anyway, but a hypothetical
    ``wiki_get_page`` (no "search" / "wiki" in the tool name) would still
    be classified correctly via the server's identity.

    can't classify, and falling back to "treat as normal" preserves all
    existing detection. False positives here are *under-detection* on a
    real exploit (low concern: retrieval tools are read-only API
